If you want to have your name in the credits and participate in a fun project (sadly cant pay) then your help would be great! you can reach me on discord! my user is **nova.brooks05** and would love to work with anyone who is good or even just starting with godot develpment!

I am still in highschool even if its just a virtual school (so i have more time), i still need to do my actually homework and school work, so things might go slow on my end and i do appologize for that.
